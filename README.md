# Project Title
Computer System Controller with NLP based Language translator semantic analyzer via Voice-commands Using Django, googletrans, pyautogui, PIL, pyDictionary, nltk, pyttsx3, paralleldots, Google-web-speech-synthesis, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, Vanilla JS, AJAX.

## Getting Started
All the source code is available inside sovmt Directory. It requires python interpreter,HTML5 Browser and Django Backend server.
* Open the source code directory and using cmd/terminal run the server with the command "python manage.py runserver".
* Open the browser following the url as "http://localhost:8000/webspeechnlp".	
* If you want to change the port you can do by the running the server with the following command "python manage.py runserver <any port number of your choice eg: 8090>" and follow the url in the browser as "http://localhost:8090/webspeechnlp".	


### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7x Interpreter
